### data cleaning and feature engineering
cleaned data so it can be compatible with regression models in R.
remodeled multiple features to make it usable while integrating in ml models.

### data analysis and visualization
plotted grahphs of multiple feature to gain further insights
from the graph it came to clear that target feature is skewed so took log of that feature( sales revenue) to normalize dataset.

### data preperation
prepared multiple subsets of data according to different regions 
split all datasets in trining and testing data

### ml models
trained 2 ml models 1> decision tree 2> linear regression on available datsets and predicted sales for all regions(us, eu, jp, global)
